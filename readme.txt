A Gutenberg block that helps you create a back-to-top button.

== Description ==
This plugin creates a block that provides a visual editor to create a back-to-top button. There are three layers that can all be stacked on top of one another. Apply color, opacity, border styles and more to each layer. The approach this visual editor takes provides a unique experience that can create visually stunning back-to-top buttons.

== Installation ==
Like any other wordpress plugin, simply upload it in the WordPress dashboard and activate. The builder will appear in the editor when you try to add a new block.

== Screenshots ==
